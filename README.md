# AMPLIFY + AWS SAM APPLICATION

Hello! Welcome to the Amplify + AWS SAM Full Stack Application project.

This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive guide and structure to build a full-stack application using AWS Amplify and AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). We leverage the powerful features of these services to create a scalable, secure, and easily maintainable web application.

The idea of this project is not to focus on the front end (UX/UI) design but rather on how to build an application using Amplify and AWS SAM.
